Hi, welcome to my blog where I write about what interests me: Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Data Science, Mathematics, Probability Theory, and other things.
I started this blog in 2015 from some notes on machine learning I took in IPython notebooks. Starting from these notebooks, it was only a small effort to publish them via GitHub Pages so that they might be of benefit to others.

Over the years I published some new blog posts. However, the number of new blog posts stayed low due to the amount of work required to write a blog post that I was happy with.
In 2021, I decided I wanted to write and share more. A way for me to achieve this would be to lower my expectations, write smaller posts, and write about more topics.  I restructured this blog and decided to be content with small posts about things I learned on the job, or during my spare time, in a [Today I Learned (#TIL)](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/) style.


### Technical side of this blog


This blog is made using [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To know more how this blog is made, and how I converted my notebooks to blog posts see my post on [hosting Jupyter notebooks on a blog](/posts/about-this-blog/).


### About me

I'm passionate about machine learning and engineering. Over the last few years, I have been working on various machine learning projects in London, UK. Currently, my workday activity is being Machine Learning Engineering Lead at [Aspect Analytics](https://www.aspect-analytics.com/) in Belgium. We're a Software company dedicated to [Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI)](https://www.aspect-analytics.com/media/blog/2020-05-31-introduction-to-msi-data-analysis/) bioinformatics, helping our clients to mine the rich data coming from MSI technology.
