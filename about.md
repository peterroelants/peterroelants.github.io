This blog started from some IPython notebooks with notes I made for myself. Starting from these notebooks, it was only a small effort to publish them on Github Pages so that they might be of benefit to others. I hope you like the posts. Comments are always welcome.


This blog is made using [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and is hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). To publish the IPython notebook files I created a [small script](https://github.com/peterroelants/peterroelants.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/notebook_convert.py) that uses [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to convert the notebooks into HTML.
