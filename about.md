Hi, welcome to my blog where I write about what interests me: Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Data Science, Mathematics, Probability Theory, and other things.
I started this blog in 2015 from some notes on machine learning I took in IPython notebooks. Starting from these notebooks, it was only a small effort to publish them via GitHub Pages so that they might be of benefit to others.


### Technical side of this blog


This blog is made using [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To know more how this blog is made, and how I converted my notebooks to blog posts see my post on [hosting Jupyter notebooks on a blog](/posts/about-this-blog/).


### About me

I'm passionate about machine learning and engineering. Over the last few years, I have been working on various machine learning projects in London, UK. Currently, my workday activity is being Director of Data Science at [Aspect Analytics](https://www.aspect-analytics.com/) in Belgium. We're a Software company dedicated to [Spatial Multi-Omics Analysis](https://www.aspect-analytics.com/media/blog/spatial-omics-part-1-the-history-and-how-of-histology), helping our clients to mine the rich data coming from different spatial measurements.
