# Diffusion Flow Matching Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks and supporting files for experiments with diffusion and flow matching methods.

## Setup

To set up the environment for these notebooks using a uv-managed project, Sync the project environment from `pyproject.toml` (and `uv.lock` if present)
```sh
uv sync
```

## Notebooks

- `01_diffusion_basics.ipynb`: Introduction to diffusion models.
- `02_flow_matching.ipynb`: Flow matching methods and experiments.
- Additional notebooks may be added for further experiments.

## Notes

- These notebooks are intended for research and educational purposes.
- For GPU acceleration, ensure you have a compatible CUDA setup.
